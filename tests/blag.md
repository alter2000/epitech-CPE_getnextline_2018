# Ligaturizer #

![](images/banner.png)

**Add ligatures to any coding font!**

This script copies the ligatures (glyphs and rendering information) from [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) into any other TrueType or OpenType font. (Note that the ligatures are scale-corrected, but otherwise copied as is from Fira Code; it doesn't create new ligature graphics based on the font you're modifying.)
